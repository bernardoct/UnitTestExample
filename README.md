# Unit Test Example in Python
There are two bugs on the code. To see them, look at the difference between the current and the first commit. Be sure to try to find them with unit testing before seeing the answer.

Instructions:
* Install the PyTest library (https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html#)
* Clone this repository.
* On the directory of the cloned repository, open a terminal (win+r, "cmd"), run command "pytest." You should get an output with some red text.
* Read the blog post about unit testing (https://waterprogramming.wordpress.com/2019/02/11/introduction-to-unit-testing/).
* Try to find the bugs on the code. The two bugs are minor but they have significant impacts on the results and are not easy to find. The mass balance Excel spreadsheet was used to write the mass balance test and may be of use when trying to find the bug.
